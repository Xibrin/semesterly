11. What is a FeatureFlowView?
   FeatureFlowView is a Django class-based view which can get some data (ex: current user info, semesters, etc.) and then pass this data to the front-end via a single json string (as response context). In practice (when trying to implement a new view), it's often best to subclass FeatureFlowView and define the feature_name class attribute and (optionally) overwrite get_feature_flow() to pass in any desired info for this new view.
